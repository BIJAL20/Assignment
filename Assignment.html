   <h2 align="left">Q-1. Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?</h2><hr>
   <h3>No, HTML tags and elements are not the same thing, although they are closely related.</h3>
   <h4 align="left"> HTML Teg:</h4>
   <p>HTML tags are used to define the structure and layout of the content within an HTML document. They are surrounded by angled brackets, such as <html>, <body>, <p>, <img>, etc. Each tag corresponds to a specific element or component of the web page, such as a paragraph, image, link, header, footer, etc.</p>
    <br>
    <h4 align="left">HTML Elements:</h4>
    <p align="left">HTML elements, on the other hand, are made up of the opening and closing tags, and the content or information that is placed between them. For example, the <p> tag is used to define a paragraph element, and the opening tag <p> marks the beginning of the paragraph, while the closing tag </p> marks the end of the paragraph.</p>

     <!-- Question 2 -->
     <h2 align="left">Q-2. What are tags and attributes in HTML?</h2><hr>
     <p align="left">In HTML, tags and attributes are used to define the structure and content of web pages</p> <br>
    <h4 align="left">HTML Tags:</h4>
    <p align="left">HTML tags are markup symbols enclosed in angle brackets (< and >) that define the structure and formatting of content within an HTML document. Tags are used to create elements and provide instructions to web browsers on how to display and interpret the content. </p>
    <p> <h3>Examples:-</h3>
      Self-closing tag:  &lt;bre &gt; defines a line break. <br>
      Paired tags:  &lt;p&gt; defines a paragraph. <br>
   Opening tag:  &lt;p&gt; closing tag:&lt;/p &gt;.
    </p>
    <h4 align="left">HTML Attributes:</h4>
    <p align="left">HTML attributes provide additional information or instructions to the elements defined by tags. <br> They are added to the opening tag of an element and consist of a name-value pair. Attributes modify the behavior, appearance, or functionality of an element. </p>
    *
    Some common attributes include:
   <br>
   <li>
    class: Specifies one or more CSS classes to style an element. </li><br>
    <li>  id: Provides a unique identifier for an element.</li> <br>
    <li>src: Specifies the source URL of an external resource, such as an image or a script.</li> <br>
    <li> href: Defines the URL or destination of a hyperlink.</li> <br>
    <li> alt: Specifies alternative text for an image.</li> <br>
    <p> <h3>Examples:-</h3>
      <p> example of an &lt;a&gt; (anchor) tag with the href attribute:</p>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYw869334hU">Click here</a>

    <h2 align="left">Q-3. What are void elements in HTML? </h2> <hr>
    <P align="left"> The structure of each HTML tag varies. Certain elements, referred to as void elements, just need an opening tag because they themselves do not contain any elements, however the majority of elements need an opening tag, a closing tag, and contents. In this article, we'll go through how to use HTML's void elements correctly.</P>
<P align="left">A void element can have characteristics but cannot contain any content. Void elements must not have a closing tag because they automatically close.</P>
<P align="left"><B>In HTML5</B>, the following elements are void:</P>
<UL style="background-color: #D3D3D3;" align="left">
    <LI>area</LI>
    <LI>base</LI>
    <LI>br</LI>

<!--Question 4-->
<h2 align="left">Q-4: What are HTML Entities? </h2> <hr>
<p>HTML entities are special codes used to represent reserved characters, symbols, and other non-textual content in HTML documents. <br> HTML entities are written using a special syntax of ampersand (&) followed by a unique entity name or number, and ending with a semicolon (;).</p>
<p>HTML entities are used to display characters and symbols that are reserved by HTML for specific purposes, such as angle brackets (< and >), ampersands (&), quotation marks (" and '), and other special characters that have a special meaning in HTML. <br> By using HTML entities, these reserved characters can be displayed as part of the normal text content without being interpreted as HTML markup. <br>
<br>
    Some common examples of HTML entities include:
    <br><br>
    <ul style="background-color: #D3D3D3;" align="left">
  <li>  & : ampersand symbol (&)</li> <br>
  <li> < : less-than symbol (<)</li> <br>
  <li> > : greater-than symbol (>) </li><br>
  <li>  " : double quotation mark (")</li><br>
  <li> ' : apostrophe (')</li><br>
</ul>
In addition to reserved characters, HTML entities can also represent non-textual content such as mathematical symbols, currency symbols, and various special characters from different languages and scripts.
<br> <br>
Using HTML entities is important for ensuring the proper display of characters and symbols in web pages, especially when working with non-standard characters or when writing content in multiple languages.

<h2 align="left">Q-5. What are different types of lists in HTML? </h2><hr>

<p align="center">In HTML, there are three types of lists that can be used to structure and organize content: ordered lists, unordered lists, and definition lists.</p>
<h2>Three type list</h2>
<p><h3>1.Ordered lists (ol):</h3><li> lists are used to present a list of items in a specific order or sequence. </li><br><li> Each item in the list is preceded by a number or letter that indicates its position in the list.</li> <br> <li>Ordered lists are created using the (ol) tag, and each item in the list is defined using the (li)tag. </li></p>
<p><h3>Examples:-</h3>
  <UL style="background-color: #D3D3D3;" align="left">
    <ol>
        <li>First item</li>
        <li>Second item</li>
        <li>Third item</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
    </UL>
<p><h3>2.Unordered lists (ul):</h3><li> Unordered lists are used to present a list of items in no particular order or sequence.</li><br><li>Each item in the list is preceded by a bullet point or other symbol. </li><br><li> Unordered lists are created using the (ul) tag, and each item in the list is defined using the (li) tag. </li></p>
      <p><h3>Examples:-</h3>
        <ul style="background-color: #D3D3D3;" align="left">
        
            <li>First item</li>
            <li>Second item</li>
            <li>Third item</li>
          </ul>
            </p>
<p><h3>3.Definition lists (dl):</h3><li>Definition lists are used to present a list of terms and their corresponding definitions.</li><br><li>Each term is defined using the (dt) tag, and its definition is defined using the (dd) tag.</li><br><li>Definition lists are created using the (dl) tag.</li> <p>
    <p><h3>Examples:-</h3></p> 
    <UL style="background-color: #D3D3D3;" align="left">  
    <dl>
        <dt>Term 1</dt>
        <dd>Definition 1</dd>
        <dt>Term 2</dt>
        <dd>Definition 2</dd>
        <dt>Term 3</dt>
        <dd>Definition 3</dd>
      </dl>      
            </p>
            <p><li>In addition to these three types of lists, HTML also provides nested lists, where one list can be included inside another list as a list item. </li><br><li> Nested lists can be created by including a new list inside a list item using the appropriate list tag. </li></p>
          </ul>
            <!-- Question 6-->

  <h2 align="left">Q-6. What is the ‘class’ attribute in HTML? </h2><hr>  
  <p>In HTML, the 'class' attribute is used to assign one or more CSS classes to an element. <br> It is used to define the element's relationship to a specific class or group of styles defined in a CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) document.
<p>The class attribute is added to the opening tag of an HTML element and consists of a space-separated list of class names. <br> Each class name represents a style or set of styles defined in CSS. <br> By assigning a class to an element, you can apply pre-defined styles to that element or target it for specific styling rules.</p>
    <h4> Example:</h4>
    <UL style="background-color: #D3D3D3;" align="left">
    <p>example of using the 'class' attribute in an HTML element:</p>
    <p class="highlight"><li> This is a paragraph with a custom class.</li></p>
    </UL>
<h4>Example:</h4>
<UL style="background-color: #D3D3D3;" align="left">
<p>The &lt;p&gt; element has been assigned the class name "highlight" using the class attribute. <br> In the associated CSS file or within a &lt;style&gt; block, you can define styles for the "highlight" class to specify how the paragraph should be visually rendered.</p>
<p>Multiple classes can be assigned to an element by including them in the 'class' attribute:
</p>
<p class="highlight important"><li> This is a paragraph with multiple classes.</li></p>
</UL>
<!-- Question 7-->

<h2 align="left">Q-7. What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ attribute of HTML
    elements?  </h2><hr>  
    <p>In HTML, both the id and class attributes are used to identify and select elements, but they have different purposes and behaviors.</p>
  <p> <b>1.Id attribute:</b>The id attribute is used to uniquely identify an element within an HTML document. <br> It must be unique, meaning no two elements in the same document can have the same id value. <br> The id attribute is typically used when you want to select a specific element for styling or scripting purposes. <br> It is often used with CSS or JavaScript to target a specific element and apply styles or perform actions on it. <br> To select an element by its id, you use the # symbol followed by the id value in CSS or JavaScript selectors.</p>
<p>Example:
  <UL style="background-color: #D3D3D3;" align="left">
  <p class="myClass">This is a paragraph element with a class</p>
<p class="myClass">This is another paragraph element with the same class</p>
</p>

<!-- Question 8-->

<h2 align="left">Q-8. What are the various formatting tags in HTML?  </h2><hr>   
<p>HTML provides several formatting tags that allow you to apply various styles and formatting to text and content. Here are some of the commonly used formatting tags in HTML:<br>
  <UL style="background-color: #D3D3D3;" align="left">
<li>&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; : They range from &lt;h1&gt; (highest level) to &lt;h6&gt; (lowest level), with &lt;h1&gt; being the most prominent.   <br>
 <br> Example : <h1>This is a heading level 1</h1>
  <h2>This is a heading level 2</h2><br>  </li>
  <li> (&lt;p&gt;): The&lt;p&gt; tag is used to define paragraphs of text. <br>
 Example :<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
  </li>
  <li>'b': The 'b' tag is used to make text bold. <br>
  Example: <b>This text is bold.</b></li> <br>
  
  <li>'i': The 'i' tag is used to make text italic. <br>
  Example: <i>This text is italicized.</i></li> <br>
  
  <li>'u': The 'u' tag is used to underline text. <br>
  Example: <u>This text is underlined.</u> </li><br>
  
  <li> 's': The 's' tag is used to create strikethrough text.<br>
  Example: <s>This text is strikethrough.</s> </li><br>
  
  <li>'strong': The 'strong' tag is used to indicate strong emphasis, typically rendered as bold. <br>
  Example: <strong>This text has strong emphasis.</strong> </li><br>
  
  <li> 'em': The 'em' tag is used to indicate emphasis, typically rendered as italic. <br>
  Example: <em>This text has emphasis.</em></li><br>
  
  <li> 'sup': The 'sup' tag is used to create superscript text, appearing above the normal text line.<br>
  Example: 2<sup>nd</sup></li> <br>
  
  <li>  'sub': The 'sub' tag is used to create subscript text, appearing below the normal text line. <br>
  Example: H<sub>2</sub>O </li><br>
   
  <li> 'code': The 'code' tag is used to represent computer code or programming instructions. <br>
  Example: <code>print("Hello, World!")</code> </li><br>

<h2 align="left">Q-9. How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing?   </h2><hr>   
<p>In HTML, both cell padding and cell spacing are attributes used in table elements (table) to control the layout and spacing of cells within a table, but they have different purposes.</p>
<p><b> 1.Cell Padding:</b> Cell padding is an attribute that controls the space between the content of a cell and the cell's borders. <br> It specifies the amount of space to be added inside each cell. The cell padding is set using the cellpadding attribute within the (table) tag or through CSS. <br> It affects the space between the content of a cell and the cell's border on all sides.</p>
<p><b> Example:</b></p>
<ul style="background-color: #D3D3D3;" align="left">
<p><table cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <td>Cell 1</td>
    <td>Cell 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</ul>
</p>
<p>In this example, a cell padding of 5 is specified, and each cell will have 5 pixels of space between the content and the cell border.</p>
<p> <b>2.Cell Spacing:</b>Cell spacing is an attribute that controls the space between adjacent cells in a table. <br> It specifies the amount of space to be added between cells. The cell spacing is set using the cellspacing attribute within the 'table' tag or through CSS. <br> It affects the space between cells, both horizontally and vertically.</p>
<p><b> Example:</b></p>
<ul style="background-color: #D3D3D3;" align="left">
<p>
  <table cellspacing="10">
    <tr>
      <td>Cell 1</td>
      <td>Cell 2</td>
    </tr>
  </table>  
</p></ul>
<p>In this example, a cell spacing of 10 is specified, and there will be 10 pixels of space between adjacent cells.</p>
<!-- Question 10-->

<h2 align="left">Q-10. How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML
  table?   </h2><hr>
  <p>In HTML, you can merge two or more rows or columns into a single row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes in the table cells ('td' or 'th'). These attributes allow you to define the span of rows or columns that a cell should occupy.</p>
  <p>Here's how you can merge rows and columns in an HTML table: <br>
   <b> Merging Rows (Vertical Merge):</b>
    To merge multiple rows into a single row, you use the rowspan attribute in the <td> or <th> element of the cell you want to span multiple rows. The rowspan attribute specifies the number of rows the cell should span.
      <ul style="background-color: #D3D3D3;" align="left">
  <br><b>Example:</b>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="2">Merged Row 1</td>
      <td>Cell 1</td>
      <td>Cell 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cell 3</td>
      <td>Cell 4</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <br></ul>
  <li>
  In this example, the first cell in the first row has a rowspan of 2, which means it will span two rows. As a result, "Merged Row 1" will occupy the space of both rows, while the other cells will be in their respective individual rows.  
</li></p>
    <p><b> Merging Columns (Horizontal Merge):</b>
      To merge multiple columns into a single column, you use the colspan attribute in the 'td' or 'th' element of the cell you want to span multiple columns. The colspan attribute specifies the number of columns the cell should span.
       <ul style="background-color: #D3D3D3;" align="left">
      <br><b>Example:</b>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>Cell 1</td>
        <td colspan="2">Merged Column 1 and 2</td>
        <td>Cell 4</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <br>
       </ul> <li>
    In this example, the second cell in the first row has a colspan of 2, which means it will span two columns. As a result, "Merged Column 1 and 2" will occupy the space of both columns, while the other cells will be in their respective individual columns.    
  </li></p> <br>
<!-- Question 11-->
  <h2> Q-11. What are logical and physical tags in HTML?</h2><hr>
  <p>
      <b>Semantic Tags:</b> Semantic tags are HTML elements that carry meaning and describe the structure of the content within the web page. <br> They provide contextual information about the content, making it easier for search engines, accessibility tools, and other technologies to understand and process the web page. <br> Semantic tags include 'header', 'nav', 'main', 'section', 'article', 'aside', 'footer', (h1) to (h6) for headings, (p) for paragraphs, (ul) and 'ol' for lists, and so <br> These tags help to organize and structure the content in a meaningful way. <br> 
<br>      <b>Presentational Tags:</b> Presentational tags, on the other hand, are HTML elements that are traditionally used for formatting and styling purposes. <br> They were widely used in older versions of HTML to define the appearance of the content but are considered less recommended in modern web development practices. <br> Examples of presentational tags include 'b' for bold text, 'i' for italic text, 'u' for underlined text, 'font' for font styles, and so on. <br> Instead of using these tags, it is generally advised to separate the content and presentation by using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).
     <li>I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. <br> In HTML, there is no specific distinction between "logical" and "physical" tags. <br> The terms "logical tags" and "physical tags" are not commonly used in the context of HTML.</li>

  <h2>Q-12.What is difference between HTML and XHTML?</h2> <hr>
  <p>
      HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) are both markup languages used to structure and present content on the web. <br> However, there are some key differences between the two
      <p>Document Structure: XHTML requires a well-defined document structure with an explicit DOCTYPE declaration at the beginning of the document, indicating the version of XHTML being used. It also mandates the use of XML namespaces for elements from other namespaces (such as MathML or SVG) to be included within the document.</p>
      <p>Browser Compatibility: HTML has been around for a long time and is widely supported by web browsers. <br> However, XHTML has stricter syntax rules and may require modifications to HTML documents to conform to XHTML standards.</p>
     <p>MIME Type: HTML documents are typically served with the "text/html" MIME type, while XHTML documents are served with the "application/xhtml+xml" MIME type.</p>
    </p> <br>
   <!-- Question 13-->
  <h2>Q-13.What is SVG? </h2> <hr>
  <p>
      1.Scalability: SVG images can be scaled up or down without any loss of quality. This makes them ideal for various purposes, including responsive web design, where graphics need to adapt to different screen sizes. <br>
      2.Vector-based: SVG images are created using geometric shapes, curves, lines, and text, defined by mathematical equations. This allows for precise rendering and manipulation of the image elements. The use of vectors also means that SVG files tend to have smaller file sizes compared to raster images, making them more suitable for web delivery.<br>
      3.XML-based: SVG files are written in XML, a markup language that defines the structure and content of the document. This XML-based format makes SVG images human-readable and allows for easy integration with other XML-based technologies.

  <h2>Q-14. What are the different tags to separate sections of text?</h2> <hr>
  <ul style="background-color: #D3D3D3;" align="left">
  <p>
 <b>&lt;p &gt;</b>: The  &lt;p &gt; tag is used to define paragraphs of text. It represents a distinct block of text with a visible line break before and after the paragraph.
<br>
<b> &lt;br &gt;</b>: The  &lt;br &gt; tag is a line break tag that inserts a single line break within a paragraph. It is a self-closing tag and does not require a closing tag.
<br>
<b> &lt;hr &gt;</b>: The  &lt;hr &gt; tag represents a horizontal rule or a thematic break between sections of content. It creates a horizontal line across the page.
<br>
 <b> &lt;pre &gt;</b>: The  &lt;pre &gt; tag is used to define preformatted text. It preserves whitespace and line breaks as they are written in the HTML code, allowing for the display of text in a fixed-width font.
<br>
 <b> &lt;blockquote &gt;</b>: The  &lt;blockquote> tag is used to indicate a block of quoted content. It is commonly used for citing external sources or presenting a section of text quoted from another source.
<br>
<b>&lt;div &gt;</b>: The  &lt;div &gt; tag is a generic container used to divide the content into logical sections or divisions. It does not imply any specific meaning or styling by itself but can be styled using CSS or targeted for scripting purposes.
 <br> </p> <br>
  </ul>
 <!-- Question 17-->

  <h2>Q-17. What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example?</h2> <hr>
  <p>
      The 'span' tag in HTML is an inline element that is used to group and apply styles to a specific section of text or a small inline portion of a document. It doesn't have any inherent semantic meaning but is rather used for styling or scripting purposes.<br>
      <b>Example :</b>
      <p>This is a <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> text.</p>

  <h2>Q-18.What is the use of an iframe tag?</h2><hr>
  <p>
      The &lt;iframe&gt; (Inline Frame) tag is an HTML element used to embed content from another source within an HTML document. <br> It allows you to display an external webpage, video, audio, or other types of content within a specified rectangular area on your web page. <br> The &lt;iframe&gt; acts as a container that encapsulates the content from a separate source.<br>
      <ul style="background-color: #D3D3D3;" align="left">
      <b>Example :</b> <br>
      <iframe src="https://www.example.com" width="500" height="300"></iframe> <br>
      In this example, the &lt;iframe&gt; tag is used to embed the content of the web page located at "https://www.example.com" within the current HTML document. <br> The src attribute specifies the source URL of the external content. <br> The width and height attributes define the dimensions of the iframe box in pixels.
